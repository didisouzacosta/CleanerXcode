### What is CleanerXcode?
CleanerXcode is a macOS tool designed to remove unnecessary Xcode files, such as Derived Data, build caches, device support files, and simulator data. It helps keep your development environment clean and efficient.

### Why use it?
Xcode can accumulate a large number of temporary files and data that take up disk space and may affect system performance. CleanerXcode solves this problem by providing a simple and effective way to free up space and improve your workflow speed.
